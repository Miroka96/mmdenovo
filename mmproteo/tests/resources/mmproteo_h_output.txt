                COMMAND [COMMAND ...]

positional arguments:
  COMMAND               the list of actions to be performed on the repository.
                        Every action can only occur once. Duplicates are
                        dropped after the first occurrence.
                        convertraw  : convert all downloaded or extracted raw
                                      files or, if none were downloaded or
                                      extracted, those raw files in the data
                                      directory, into the given thermo output
                                      format using the ThermoRawFileParser.
                                      This command requires an accessible
                                      Docker installation.
                        download    : download files from a given project.
                        extract     : extract all downloaded archive files or,
                                      if none were downloaded, those in the
                                      data directory. Currently, the following
                                      archive formats are supported: "gz",
                                      "zip"
                        info        : request project information for a given
                                      project.
                        list        : list files and their attributes in a
                                      given project.
                        mgf2parquet : convert all downloaded, extracted, or
                                      converted mgf files into parquet format,
                                      or, if no files were previously
                                      processed, convert the mgf files in the
                                      data directory.
                        mz2parquet  : merge and convert all downloaded or
                                      extracted mzid and mzml files into
                                      parquet format or, if no files were
                                      previously processed, merge and convert
                                      the files in the data directory.
                        showconfig  : print all variables of the current run
                                      configuration.

optional arguments:
  --count-failed-files  Count failed files and do not just ignore them. This
                        is relevant for the max-num-files parameter. (default:
                        False)
  --dummy-logger        Use a simpler log format and log to stdout. (default:
                        False)
  --file-extensions EXT, -e EXT
                        a list of comma-separated allowed file extensions to
                        filter files for. Archive extensions will be
                        automatically appended. An empty list deactivates
                        filtering. Capitalization does not matter. (default: )
  --filter COLUMN[=!]=REGEX, -f COLUMN[=!]=REGEX
                        a filter condition for file filtering. The condition
                        must be of the form 'columnName[=!]=valueRegex'.
                        Therefore, the comparison operator can either be '=='
                        or '!='. The column name must not contain these
                        character patterns. The value will be interpreted
                        using Python's rules for regular expressions (from the
                        Python 're' package). This parameter can be given
                        multiple times to enforce multiple filters
                        simultaneously, meaning the filters will be logically
                        connected using a boolean 'and'. Boolean 'or'
                        operations can be specified as ' or ' within any
                        filter parameter, for example like this (representing
                        (a==1 or b==2) and (c==3 or (not d==4))): 'mmproteo -f
                        "a==1 or b==2" -f "c==3 or d!=4" list'. A condition
                        can be negated using '!=' instead of '=='. For the
                        filtering process, the filter columns will be
                        converted to strings. Non-existent columns will be
                        ignored. Capitalization matters. All these rules add
                        up to a conjunctive normal form. As some commands can
                        be pipelined to use previous results, there are also
                        the following special column names available:
                        ["converted_mgf_parquet_files",
                        "converted_mzmlid_parquet_files",
                        "converted_raw_files", "downloadLink",
                        "downloaded_files", "extracted_files", "fileName"]. An
                        empty list disables this filter. (default: [])
  --help, -h            Show this help message and exit.
  --log-file FILE, -l FILE
                        the name of the log file, relative to the download
                        directory. Set it to an empty string ("") to disable
                        file logging. (default: mmproteo.log)
  --log-to-stdout       Log to stdout instead of stderr. (default: False)
  --max-num-files N, -n N
                        the maximum number of files to be downloaded. Set it
                        to '0' to download all files. (default: 0)
  --no-count-skipped-files
                        Do not count skipped files and just ignore them. This
                        is relevant for the max-num-files parameter. (default:
                        True)
  --no-fail-early       Do not fail commands already on failed assertions. The
                        code will run until a real exception is encountered or
                        it even succeeds. (default: False)
  --no-skip-existing    Do not skip existing files. (default: False)
  --pride-project PROJECT, -p PROJECT
                        the name of the PRIDE project, e.g. 'PXD010000' from '
                        https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/peptide/list/pr
                        oject/PXD010000'. For some commands, this parameter is
                        required. (default: None)
  --pride-version {1,2}, -i {1,2}
                        an API version for the PRIDE interactions. Only the
                        specified versions will be used. This parameter can be
                        given multiple times to allow multiple different API
                        versions, one version per parameter appearance. The
                        order of occurring API versions will be considered
                        until the first API request fulfills its job. Every
                        version should appear at most once. Duplicates are
                        dropped after the first occurrence. An empty list
                        (default) uses all api versions in the following
                        order: ["2", "1"] (default: [])
  --shown-columns COLUMNS, -c COLUMNS
                        a list of comma-separated column names. Some commands
                        show their results as tables, so their output columns
                        will be limited to those in this list. An empty list
                        deactivates filtering. Capitalization matters.
                        (default: )
  --storage-dir DIR, -d DIR
                        the name of the directory, in which the downloaded
                        files and the log file will be stored. (default: .)
  --thermo-keep-running
                        Keep the ThermoRawFileParser Docker container running
                        after conversion. This can speed up batch processing
                        and ease debugging. (default: False)
  --thermo-output-format {imzml,mgf,mzml,parquet}
                        the output format into which the raw file will be
                        converted. This parameter only applies to the
                        convertraw command. (default: mgf)
  --thread-count THREADS
                        the number of threads to use for parallel processing.
                        Set it to '0' to use as many threads as there are CPU
                        cores. Setting the number of threads to '1' disables
                        parallel processing. (default: 1)
  --verbose, -v         Increase output verbosity to debug level. (default:
                        False)
  --version             Show the version of this software.
