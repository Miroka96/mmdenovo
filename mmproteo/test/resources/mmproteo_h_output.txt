                        Every action can only occur once. Duplicates are

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PRIDE_PROJECT, --pride-project PRIDE_PROJECT
                        the name of the PRIDE project, e.g. 'PXD010000' from '
                        https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/peptide/list/pr
                        oject/PXD010000'. For some commands, this parameter is
                        required. (default: None)
  -n MAX_NUM_FILES, --max-num-files MAX_NUM_FILES
                        the maximum number of files to be downloaded. Set it
                        to '0' to download all files. (default: 0)
  --count-failed-files  Count failed files and do not just skip them. This is
                        relevant for the max-num-files parameter. (default:
                        True)
  -d STORAGE_DIR, --storage-dir STORAGE_DIR
                        the name of the directory, in which the downloaded
                        files and the log file will be stored. (default: .)
  -l LOG_FILE, --log-file LOG_FILE
                        the name of the log file, relative to the download
                        directory. (default: downloader.log)
  --log-to-stdout       Log to stdout instead of stderr. (default: False)
  -c SHOWN_COLUMNS, --shown-columns SHOWN_COLUMNS
                        a list of comma-separated column names. Some commands
                        show their results as tables, so their output columns
                        will be limited to those in this list. An empty list
                        deactivates filtering. Capitalization matters.
                        (default: )
  -t VALID_FILE_EXTENSIONS, --valid-file-extensions VALID_FILE_EXTENSIONS
                        a list of comma-separated allowed file extensions to
                        filter files for. An empty list deactivates filtering.
                        Capitalization does not matter. (default: )
  -e, --no-skip-existing
                        Do not skip existing files. (default: False)
  -v, --verbose         Increase output verbosity to debug level. (default:
                        False)
  -f, --no-fail-early   Do not fail already on warnings. (default: False)
  --version             show the version of this software
  -i {1,2}, --pride-version {1,2}
                        an API version for the PRIDE interactions. Only the
                        specified versions will be used. This parameter can be
                        given multiple times to allow multiple different API
                        versions, one version per parameter appearance. The
                        order of occurring API versions will be considered
                        until the first API request fulfills its job. Every
                        version should appear at most once. Duplicates are
                        dropped after the first occurrence. An empty list
                        (default) uses all api versions in the following
                        order: ["1", "2"] (default: [])
