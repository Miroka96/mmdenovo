                COMMAND [COMMAND ...]

positional arguments:
  COMMAND               the list of actions to be performed on the repository.
                        Every action can only occur once. Duplicates are
                        dropped after the first occurrence.

                                      data directory. Currently, the following
                                      archive formats are supported: "gz",

                                      or, if no files were previously
                                      processed, convert the mgf files in the
                                      data directory
                        mz2parquet  : merge and convert all downloaded or
                                      extracted mzid and mzml files into
                                      parquet format or, if no files were
                                      previously processed, merge and convert
                                      the files in the data directory.

optional arguments:
  --count-failed-files  Count failed files and do not just skip them. This is
                        relevant for the max-num-files parameter. (default:
                        True)
  --dummy-logger        Use a simpler log format and log to stdout. (default:
                        False)
  --help, -h            Show this help message and exit.
  --log-file LOG_FILE, -l LOG_FILE
                        the name of the log file, relative to the download
                        directory. Set it to an empty string ("") to disable
                        file logging. (default: mmproteo.log)
  --log-to-stdout       Log to stdout instead of stderr. (default: False)
  --max-num-files MAX_NUM_FILES, -n MAX_NUM_FILES
                        the maximum number of files to be downloaded. Set it
                        to '0' to download all files. (default: 0)
  --no-fail-early, -f   Do not fail already on warnings. (default: False)
  --no-skip-existing, -e
                        Do not skip existing files. (default: False)
  --pride-project PRIDE_PROJECT, -p PRIDE_PROJECT
                        the name of the PRIDE project, e.g. 'PXD010000' from '
                        https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ws/archive/peptide/list/pr
                        oject/PXD010000'. For some commands, this parameter is
                        required. (default: None)
  --pride-version {1,2}, -i {1,2}
                        an API version for the PRIDE interactions. Only the
                        specified versions will be used. This parameter can be
                        given multiple times to allow multiple different API
                        versions, one version per parameter appearance. The
                        order of occurring API versions will be considered
                        until the first API request fulfills its job. Every
                        version should appear at most once. Duplicates are
                        dropped after the first occurrence. An empty list
                        (default) uses all api versions in the following
                        order: ["2", "1"] (default: [])
  --shown-columns SHOWN_COLUMNS, -c SHOWN_COLUMNS
                        a list of comma-separated column names. Some commands
                        show their results as tables, so their output columns
                        will be limited to those in this list. An empty list
                        deactivates filtering. Capitalization matters.
                        (default: )
  --storage-dir STORAGE_DIR, -d STORAGE_DIR
                        the name of the directory, in which the downloaded
                        files and the log file will be stored. (default: .)
  --thermo-keep-running
                        Keep the ThermoRawFileParser Docker container running
                        after conversion. This can speed up batch processing
                        and ease debugging. (default: False)
  --thermo-output-format {imzml,mgf,mzml,parquet}
                        the output format into which the raw file will be
                        converted. This parameter only applies to the
                        convertraw command. (default: mgf)
  --valid-file-extensions VALID_FILE_EXTENSIONS, -t VALID_FILE_EXTENSIONS
                        a list of comma-separated allowed file extensions to
                        filter files for. An empty list deactivates filtering.
                        Capitalization does not matter. (default: )
  --verbose, -v         Increase output verbosity to debug level. (default:
                        False)
  --version             Show the version of this software.
